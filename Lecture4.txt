CSS

overrides defaults
still controlled by the www (W3C) unlike html (check CSS/current-work and notice the colors and status codes)
1.inline
2. <style> in <head>
3. <link> for external files

Cascading might cause conflicts (multiple includes)

. is used for classes
P.special {
    color : green;
    border: solid red;
}
<LINK href='test.css'>
<P class='special'>this will be displayed with the css

P.something: Applies only to paragraphs (notice the P)
.something: Applies to any element, generic class

id was supposed to be used only once, but it might not be. It is same as class?

<div> block tag, no predefined properties
<div class="class name">

<span> same as div but smaller (one word)

CSS one file for a site, same style repeated and cached for speed

Serif fonts vs sans serif (serif has the extrusions, sans has them cut off)

Pseudo elements and classes (elements used for link color change for example)

corssed lines mean that there was a conflict and lost (in inspect)
